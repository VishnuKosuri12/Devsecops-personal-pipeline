.DS_Store # macOS specific
Thumbs.db # Windows specific

# Important: Only include *.md if you absolutely don't want ANY markdown files committed.
# This is usually NOT desired as README.md, docs/*.md are important.
# If you only want to ignore specific temporary .md files, list them explicitly:
# temp.md
# scratchpad.md
# *.md # <-- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE ONLY IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT TO IGNORE ALL MARKDOWN

# Kubernetes specific files - only ignore if they contain sensitive, non-committable info
# Otherwise, Kubernetes config files are typically committed.
# For example, if you have a secrets file that should not be committed:
# kubernetes/secrets.yaml
# k8s/secrets.yaml

# Git related files (implicitly ignored by Git, no need to add here)
# .git/
# .gitignore
